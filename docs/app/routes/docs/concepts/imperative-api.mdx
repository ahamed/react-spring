# Imperative API

This addition is new to version 9 of `react-spring`. It is an
extension & really an upgrade of the old `set` API from v8.

## What is it?

Behind every `useSpring` hook is a [`Controller`](/docs/concepts/controllers-and-springs#Controller) instance.

_Discuss how its an abstraction based on
Controller Methods & actually can contain
many controllers similar to how controllers
can contain many spring values_

## Why should I use it?

_Give example where you're setting state to
trigger an animation, try to use a real life
example._

_Discuss how it's an unnecessary react render
that in most cases it can be omitted & therefore
decomplicates components._

_Discuss react-three-fiber and the benefits of
imperative programming in the field of 3D work._

_Discuss how it's other methods can be useful._

## How do I access it?

_Discuss the use of useSpringRef, or more realistically,
passing a function to the hooks you get springs returned
from._

_Explain that this is why the docs lead this way
because it is a better pattern._
